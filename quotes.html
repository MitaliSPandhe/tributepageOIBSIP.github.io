  <strong class="quote">1.“Take up an idea, devote yourself, struggle in patience, and the sun will rise.”</strong><br>
<p class="para">When you think of doing something, decide that you are going to work toward it with all you have. Immerse yourself and get through the tough times with patience, because good things do not come easy. Be honest in your efforts and believe that the sun will shine on you.</p>

<strong class="quote">2.“Arise, awake, and don’t stop till you reach your goal.”</strong><br>
<p class="para">
  This Swami Vivekananda quote talks about the power of consistency striving towards your goal. It is easy to go off-road and forget why we started doing something. Reminding yourself about it every day and putting in the work will take effort. However, doing the work and doing it consistently are the only things that will get you where you want to go.</p>

  <strong class="quote">3. “The moral, in one word, is that you are divine.” </strong><br>
<p class="para">
  The thought of God dwelling in every being and everything around us is empowering. When you see everything including yourself as divine, you are filled with love and belief in yourself. Love and belief are the greatest forces of nature and there’s nothing you cannot achieve with those two in your hands.
  .</p>

  <strong class="quote">4. “In a day, when you don’t come across any problems – you can be sure that you are traveling the wrong path”</strong><br>
<p class="para">
  Success and progress do not come easy. If it were so, you would learn nothing and you would not grow at all. The first step towards achieving something is accepting that it will not come easy. You have to face challenges. But in the end, it is all going to be worth it!
 </p>

  <strong class="quote">5. “We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.”</strong><br>
<p class="para">
  What you think defines who you are. We may feel that we don’t have control over our thoughts, but we actually do. Train your mind and thoughts to serve you. Words can be manipulated and you may not always speak what is on your mind. But your thoughts reflect on your being. They multiply and reach places, so take care of what you think.
 </p>

  <strong class="quote">6. “Dare to be free, dare to go as far as your thought leads and dare to carry that out in your life.”</strong><br>
<p class="para">
  If you can think about it, you can certainly do it. Have the courage to bring your dreams to fruition. Go after what you desire because that is the only way to make it your reality.
  </p>

  <strong class="quote">7. “The great secret of true success, of true happiness is this: the man or woman who asks for no return, the perfectly unselfish person is the most successful.” </strong><br>
<p class="para">
  True success can only come from selflessness. You cannot pursue something in the hope of attaining certain results, material pleasure, or fame. Your only intention should be to do your work to the best of your ability and believe that the rest will follow. This is the only way to true success and happiness.
