<li>He worked in the field of social service.</li>
<li>  He spoke to people in India and urged them to eliminate the caste system and promote science and industrialisation.</li>
<li> He also inspired many people to join the freedom struggle, thereby contributing to the rise of the national independence movement.</li>
<li>He urged the youth of the country to fight colonial oppression, do social service and work for the people in unity.</li>
<li>His teachings opened up interfaith debates and interfaith awareness.</li>
<li>He also worked against superstitions and advocated the upliftment of women’s position in society.</li>
<li>He wanted the people to embrace the spirit of equality and free-thinking.</li>
<li>His interpretation of Vedanta is called neo-Vedanta.</li>
<li>He worked towards a better understanding of Hinduism and also towards nationalism.</li>
<li>According to him, the best form of worship was the service of the people.</li>
<li>He laid stress on physical and moral strength. One of his many quotes says, “You Will Be Nearer To Heaven through Football than through the Study of the Gita.”</li>
